    <h1>Adobo Recipes</h1>
    <img src="../images/adobo3.jpg" alt="Pork Adobo 3">
    <p>This version is inspired by Filipino pork adobo, which relies heavily on vinegar, 
        black pepper, and soy sauce. You can use coconut vinegar, which is prominent in 
        Filipino cuisine, or you can use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar instead. 
        Black pepper in this case is whole peppercorns, which cook alongside the pork 
        until they too are tender to the bite, providing little pops of spice and texture 
        with every spoonful.</p>
        <p>Marinade</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 c. low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 c. plus 3 tbsp. distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 c. packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. sriracha (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp. grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 1/2 lb. skin-on pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2" pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adobo and Assembly</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. virgin coconut oil</li>
            <li>2 small yellow onions, each cut into 6 wedges</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li>1 dried ancho chile, stemmed (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves </li>
            <li>2 c. water</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. MSG (optional)</li>
            <li>Cooked rice, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Marinade</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, fish sauce, sriracha, if using, and ginger. Add pork and toss to evenly coat, then set aside while preparing remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Adobo and Assembly</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion, garlic, chile, if using, peppercorns, salt, and bay leaves, stirring occasionally, until garlic is lightly golden, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain pork; reserve marinade. Increase heat to high and add pork to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pan is dry and pork is lightly caramelized, 17 to 19 minutes. Add reserved marinade and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender and can be cut with a spoon, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Uncover, increase heat to medium-high, and continue to simmer until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves. Stir in MSG, if using.</li>
            <li>Place rice on a platter. Top with pork and pour sauce over.</li>
        </ol>
