    <p>Philippine adobo is a Spanish-influenced meat dish consisting of a 
        tangy sauce of vinegar, garlic, soy sauce and black pepper. 
        Vinegar is a common ingredient found in many Filipino dishes 
        and it’s one of the main ingredients in any adobo. 
        Some may regard Adobo to be the national dish of the 
        Philippines because it is so popular. There are so many 
        different versions of this dish around as people have adapted 
        this dish to their own taste.  One such variant is a more modern 
        take that does not use soy sauce (adobong puti or white adobo).</p>
